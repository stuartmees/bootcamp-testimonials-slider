# Frontend Mentor Task - Coding Bootcamp Testimonials Slider

## My Focus For the Task:

1) To use semantic HTML

2) To implement a slight modular approach with Vannilla JS and no module bundlar, whilst keeping vaiables out the global name space using IIFE - only implemented here by keeping the array of data in a separate module.

3) Arrange CSS appropriately using appropraite names.

4) To produce app so it resembles the design as closely as possible.

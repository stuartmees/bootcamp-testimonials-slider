# Frontend Mentor Task - Coding Bootcamp Testimonials Slider

Used to devloping apps using React, SCSS and Webpacks so wanted to keep this one simple and take it back to basics (and try and focius on them!) using only Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS.

## My Focus For the Task:

1) To use semantic HTML

2) To implement a slight modular approach with Vannilla JS and no module bundlar, whilst keeping vaiables out the global name space using IIFE - only implemented here by keeping the array of data in a separate module.

3) Arrange CSS appropriately using appropraite names.

4) To produce webpage so it resembles the design as closely as possible.

## Next steps:

1) Add more break points so webpage looks better between ~400px and 1040px
